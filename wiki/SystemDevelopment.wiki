=System Development=

==Phone part==
===Hardware===
 * STLC3080: not chosen, can't create ringing signal automatically
 * STLC3075: created especially for wireless local loops

==Base Station part==
===Hardware===
 * AS2523: 
  * some problems to be expected with galvanic isolation to telephone network.
  * not easily interfaceable by MCU.
 * AS2533: not chosen, has serial interface and hands free features, but no DTMF-signalling
 * U3716MB-T, U32001, U3900BM, TEA7092, TEA7540, TEA5400, TEA1098: some of these are interesting, but none of them is available.
 * Dry or wet transformer for connecting to telephone line?
  * Dry transformer can't handle DC-voltages, DC-blocking capacitors needed.
  * Wet transformers can handle DC-voltages without saturating.  They are bigger and waste that DC-current off course.
 * AS2540:
  * Created especially for remote control by MCU.
  * Automatic ring detection to MCU
  * SOIC28: easily solderable.

==CODEC==
The voice information can be sent in an analog or a digital version to the communicating devices.  The choice is made to use digital transmission, because it's then easier to implement control codes in the data.  Embedding control codes in analog signals can be quite complicated (e.g. the analog television signal).
This decision has the drawback that an audio CODEC is needed to convert the analog audio signal to its digital version and vice versa.

Possible ICs:

 * AD73311: not chosen.  It delivers 16-bit data.  There is not enough bandwidth to send 16bit data over the wireless channel at the desired sampling rate.
 * TP3054/TP3057: These devices use logarithmic PCM.  They compand an internal 13or 14-bit signal to an 8-bit signal on the digital port.  The companding algorithm works using Âµ-law for the TP3054 and A-law for the TP3057.   More information to be found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.711 ITU-T G.711]
 * WM8510

==Software==
* G.711 Appendix I defines a Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) algorithm to help hide transmission losses in a packetized network.
