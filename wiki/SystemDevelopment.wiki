==Phone part==
===Hardware===
 * STLC3080: not chosen, can't create ringing signal automatically
 * STLC3075: created especially for wireless local loops

==Base Station part==
===Hardware===
 * AS2523: some problems to be expected with galvanic isolation to telephone network.
 * AS2533: not chosen, has serial interface and hands free features, but no DTMF-signalling
 * U3716MB-T, U32001, U3900BM, TEA7092, TEA7540, TEA5400, TEA1098: some of these are interesting, but none of them is available.
 * Dry or wet transformer for connecting to telephone line?
  * Dry transformer can't handle DC-voltages, DC-blocking capacitors needed.
  * Wet transformers can handle DC-voltages without saturating.  They are bigger and waste that DC-current off course.
