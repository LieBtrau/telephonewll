 * STLC3080: not chosen, can't create ringing signal automatically
 * STLC3075: 
  * created especially for wireless local loops
  * it's hard to get (not available at RS, Farnell, Mouser, Digikey)
  * ST states it as an obsolete component
 * [http://www.silabs.com/Marcom%20Documents/Resources/Si3210ProductBrief.pdf Si3210M-FT]
  * active high for enabling DC for ringer
  * € 7,84 at Mouser
  * Extra Si3201-GS (€1.83) needed, or using lots of discrete components

  * active low for enabling DC for ringer
  * € 7,03 at Mouser
  * Extra Si3201-GS (€1.83) needed, or using lots of discrete components
  * When ringer is needed, this circuit can not work on 3.3V (datasheet table 21)
 * Si3215 & Si3216 are harder to get (non-stock at Mouser)
