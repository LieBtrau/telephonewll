===Modules solutions===
 * [http://www.silvertel.com/tel_products.htm Silvertel SLICs]
  * Some have integrated ringing generator, no HV needed.
  * No DTMF decoding
  * ADC/DAC needed (maybe MCU peripheral)
===Single chip solutions===
Search on the internet for: [http://lmgtfy.com/?q=SLIC+interface SLIC-interface]
 * STLC3080: not chosen, can't create ringing signal automatically
 * STLC3075: 
  * created especially for wireless local loops
  * it's hard to get (not available at RS, Farnell, Mouser, Digikey)
  * ST states it as an obsolete component
 * *[http://www.silabs.com/Marcom%20Documents/Resources/Si3210ProductBrief.pdf Si3210-FT]*
  * active high for enabling DC for ringer
  * € 7,84 at Mouser
  * Extra Si3201-GS (€1.83) needed, or using lots of discrete components
 * [http://www.silabs.com/Marcom%20Documents/Resources/Si3210ProductBrief.pdf SI3210-GT] 
  * active low for enabling DC for ringer
  * € 7,03 at Mouser
  * Extra Si3201-GS (€1.83) needed, or using lots of discrete components
  * When ringer is needed, this circuit can not work on 3.3V (datasheet table 21)
 * Si3215 & Si3216 are harder to get (non-stock at Mouser)

The design of [http://code.google.com/p/openusbfxs/  OpenUsbFxs], as well as the numerous Silicon Labs application notes, were a good starting point for me.
I calculated some component values for the interface myself, but I'll start by using the OpenUsbFxs schematic.  Just to be sure.

== Hardware design ==

In order to create a more open hardware platform, I decided to design the POTS-interface as an Arduino-shield.
It could also be used for Arduino users (if they want to create software drivers for it).  Maybe an idea for [http://code.google.com/p/potsduino/ POTSduino]?
